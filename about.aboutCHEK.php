            <h1>C.H.E.K. Philosophy</h1>
            <br />
            <p class="text-justify">So what is C.H.E.K. and what is their philosophy I here you ask?</p>
            <p>Well, C.H.E.K. stands for Corrective, Holistic, Exercise Kinesiology and relates to the <a href="http://www.chekinstitute.com" target="_blank">C.H.E.K. Institute in America</a>  founded by Holistic Health Practitioner Paul Chek.</p>
            <p>Paul Chek is an internationally-renowned expert in the fields of corrective and high performance exercise kinesiology, with over 26 years of experience in the field, developing his own holistic approach to health, through his own continual learning and experiences throughout his career. This holistic approach he successfully delivers to his own clients, as well as teaching to students wishing to enhance their own knowledge and understanding in the area of health, fitness and well-being, subsequently improving the health of their own clients.</p>

            <p>Having myself studied up to degree level in the fields of sport, exercise and personal training, the C.H.E.K. approach was introduced to me in 2011 and instantly struck a chord with me by helping me further understand the importance of addressing the body and mind as a whole, providing a holistic approach to improving individuals health through a combination of nutrition, exercise and lifestyle interventions.</p>
            <p>As with any profession, the C.H.E.K. Institute requires their students to continually learn and develop as personal trainers and holistic health practitioners, providing a structured approach to education that enables the student to continually expand their knowledge and understanding, therefore being able to provide the best possible advice, guidance and coaching to their clients.</p>
            <p>As a C.H.E.K. Exercise Coach and C.H.E.K. Holistic Lifestyle Coach Level 1(HLC1), I am trained to design and deliver bespoke exercise programs that encompass exercise, nutrition and lifestyle strategies, facilitating integration of mind-body fitness and traditional exercise prescription.
            <p>The Exercise Coach qualification specifically enables me to carry out a series of assessments to ascertain each individual’s physiological load, taking into account posture, core/back function, imbalances and deficits, as well as physical and emotional stress levels. This vital information allows me to design the best possible program to help meet the clients’ specific requirements, whether they have a low, moderate or high physiological load, implementing a wide variety of exercises that will enhance posture and lead to improved function and overall well-being.</p>
            <p>The HLC1 qualification works in tandem with the Exercise Coach skills, enabling me to explore the clients nutritional and lifestyle backgrounds through a series of questionnaires, focusing on ascertaining the clients Metabolic Type (ideal ratio of carbs:fats;proteins that best fits their biological profile), as well as highlighting any issues around digestion, detoxification, sleep, stress and other lifestyle factors. This then enables me to provide a bespoke strategy for each individual moving forward, to best enable them to elevate their health.</p>
            <p>All of these philosophies are designed to help you be the best you can be, whatever your goal, dream or performance level is.
